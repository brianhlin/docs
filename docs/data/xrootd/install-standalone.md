Install XRootD Standalone
=========================

!!!bug "EL7 version compatibility"
    There is an incompatibility with EL7 < 7.5 due to an issue with the `globus-gsi-proxy-core` package


[XRootD](http://xrootd.org/) is a hierarchical storage system that can be used in a variety of ways to access data,
typically distributed among actual storage resources. In this document we focus on using XRootD as a simple layer
exporting an underlying storage system (e.g., [HDFS](../install-hadoop.md)) to the outside world.

Before Starting
---------------

Before starting the installation process, consider the following points:

-   **User IDs:** If it does not exist already, the installation will create the Linux user ID `xrootd`
-   **Service certificate:** The XRootD service uses a host certificate and key pair at
    `/etc/grid-security/xrd/xrdcert.pem` and `/etc/grid-security/xrd/xrdkey.pem`
-   **Networking:** The XRootD service uses port 1094 by default

As with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:

-   Ensure the host has [a supported operating system](../../release/supported_platforms.md)
-   Obtain root access to the host
-   Prepare [the required Yum repositories](../../common/yum.md)
-   Install [CA certificates](../../common/ca.md)

Installing XRootD
-----------------

To install the XRootD Standalone server, run the following Yum command:

``` console
root@xrootd-standalone # yum install osg-xrootd-standalone
```

Configuring XRootD
------------------

To configure XRootD as a standalone server, you will modify `/etc/xrootd/xrootd-standalone.cfg` and the config files
under `/etc/xrootd/config.d/` as follows:

1.  Configure a `rootdir` in `/etc/xrootd/config.d/10-common-site-local.cfg`, to point to the top of the directory
    hierarchy which you wish to serve via XRootD.

        set rootdir = <DIRECTORY>

    !!! warning
        Do not set `rootdir` to `/`.
        This might result in serving private information.

1.  If you want to limit the sub-directories to serve under your configured `rootdir`,
    comment out the `all.export /` directive in
    `/etc/xrootd/config.d/90-osg-standalone-paths.cfg`,
    and add an `all.export` directive for each directory under `rootdir` that you wish to serve via XRootD.
    
    This is useful if you have a mixture of files under your `rootdir`, for example from multiple users,
    but only want to expose a subset of them to the world.
    
    For example, to serve the contents of `/data/store` and `/data/public` (with `rootdir` configured to `/data`):

        all.export /store/
        all.export /public/

    If you want to serve everything under your configured `rootdir`, you don't have to change anything.

    !!! note
        The directories specified this way are writable by default.
        Access controls should be managed via [authorization configuration](#configuring-authorization).

1. In `/etc/xrootd/config.d/10-common-site-local.cfg`, add a line to set the `resourcename` variable to the
   [resource name](../../common/registration.md#registering-resources) of your XRootD service.
   For example, the XRootD service registered at the
   [University of Florida site](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/blob/b14218d6e9d9df013a42e4d8538b2eeea615514c/topology/University%20of%20Florida/UF%20HPC/UFlorida-HPC.yaml#L250)
   should set the following configuration:

        set resourcename = UFlorida-XRD

    !!! note
        CMS sites should follow CMS policy for `resourcename`

### Configuring authorization

To configure XRootD authorization please follow the documentation [here](xrootd-authorization.md).

### Optional configuration

The following configuration steps are optional and will likely not be required for setting up a small site.
If you do not need any of the following special configurations, skip to
[the section on using XRootD](#using-xrootd).

#### Enabling Hadoop support (EL 7 Only)

Hadoop File System (HDFS) based sites should utilize the `xrootd-hdfs` plugin to allow XRootD to access their storage:

1. Install the XRootD HDFS plugin package:

        :::console
        root@host # yum install xrootd-hdfs

1. Add the following configuration to `/etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg`:

        :::file
        ofs.osslib /usr/lib64/libXrdHdfs.so

For more information, see [the HDFS installation documents](../install-hadoop.md).


#### Enabling multi-user support

By default XRootD servers write files on the storage system aa the Unix user `xrootd` instead of the [authenticated](xrootd-authorization.md) user.
The `xrootd-multiuser` plugins changes this behaviour:

1. Install the XRootD multi-user plugin:

        :::console
        root@host # yum install xrootd-multiuser

1. Start the XRootD process in privileged mode:

        :::console
        root@host # systemctl xrootd-privileged@standalone

!!! bug
    The multiuser support is incompatible with checksums.

!!! note
    This is not necessary when XRootD is used for read-only access


#### Enabling CMS TFC support (CMS sites only)

For CMS users, there is a package available to integrate rule-based name lookup using a `storage.xml` file.
If you are not setting up a CMS site, you can skip this section.

``` console
yum install --enablerepo=osg-contrib xrootd-cmstfc
```

You will need to add your `storage.xml` to `/etc/xrootd/storage.xml` and then add the following line to your XRootD
configuration:

``` file
# Integrate with CMS TFC, placed in /etc/xrootd/storage.xml
oss.namelib /usr/lib64/libXrdCmsTfc.so file:/etc/xrootd/storage.xml?protocol=hadoop
```

Add the orange text only if you are running hadoop (see below).

See the CMS TWiki for more information:

-   <https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Main/HdfsXrootdInstall>

Using XRootD
------------

In addition to the XRootD service itself, there are a number of supporting services in your installation.
The specific services are:

| Software         | Service Name                            | Notes                                                                        |
|:-----------------|:----------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fetch CRL        | `fetch-crl-boot` and `fetch-crl-cron`   | See [CA documentation](../../common/ca.md#managing-fetch-crl-services) for more info |
| XRootD           | EL 7:`xrootd@standalone` | |
| XRootD Multiuser | EL 7:`xrootd-privileged@standalone`     | See [XRootD multiuser](#enabling-multi-user-support) for more info           |

Start the services in the order listed and stop them in reverse order.
As a reminder, here are common service commands (all run as `root`):

| To …                                        | On EL 7, run the command…        |
|:--------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------|
| Start a service                             | `systemctl start SERVICE-NAME`   |
| Stop a service                              | `systemctl stop SERVICE-NAME`    |
| Enable a service to start during boot       | `systemctl enable SERVICE-NAME`  |
| Disable a service from starting during boot | `systemctl disable SERVICE-NAME` |

Validating XRootD
-----------------

To validate an XRootD installation, perform the following verification steps:

!!! note
    If you have configured authentication/authorization for XRootD,
    be sure you have given yourself the necessary permissions to run these tests.
    For example, if you are using a grid proxy,
    make sure your DN is mapped to a user in [/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile](../../security/lcmaps-voms-authentication.md#mapping-users),
    and make sure you have a valid proxy on your local machine.
    Also, ensure that the [Authfile](xrootd-authorization.md#authorization-file) on the XRootD server gives write access to the Unix user you will get mapped to.

1. Verify file transfer over the XRootD protocol using XRootD client tools:

    1. Install the client tools:

            :::console
            root@xrootd-standalone # yum install xrootd-client

    1. Copy a file to a directory for which you have write access:

            :::console
            root@xrootd-standalone # xrdcp /bin/sh root://localhost:1094//tmp/first_test
            [xrootd] Total 0.76 MB  [====================] 100.00 % [inf MB/s]

    1. Verify that the file has been copied over:

            :::console
            root@xrootd-standalone # ls -l /tmp/first_test
            -rw-r--r-- 1 xrootd xrootd 801512 Apr 11 10:48 /tmp/first_test

1. Verify file transfer over HTTP using GFAL2 client tools:

    1. Install the GFAL2 client tools:

            :::console
            root@xrootd-standalone # yum install gfal2-util gfal2-plugin-http

    1. Copy a file to a directory for which you have write access:

            :::console
            root@xrootd-standalone # gfal-copy /bin/sh http://localhost:1094//tmp/first_test

    1. Verify that the file has been copied over:

            :::console
            root@xrootd-standalone # ls -l /tmp/first_test
            -rw-r--r-- 1 xrootd xrootd 801512 Apr 11 10:48 /tmp/first_test

Registering an XRootD Standalone Server
---------------------------------------

To register your XRootD server, follow the general registration instructions
[here](../../common/registration.md#new-resources) with the following XRootD-specific details:

1.  Add an `XRootD component:` section to the `Services:` list, with any relevant fields for that service.
    This is a partial example:

        :::console
        ...
        FQDN: <FULLY QUALIFIED DOMAIN NAME>
        Services:
          XRootD component:
            Description: Standalone XRootD server
        ...

    Replacing `<FULLY QUALIFIED DOMAIN NAME>` with your XRootD server's DNS entry.

2.  If you are setting up a new resource, set `Active: false`.
    Only set `Active: true` for a resource when it is accepting requests and ready for production.

### Service Configuration

The configuration that your XRootD service uses is determined by the service name given to `systemctl`.
To use the standalone config, you would start XRootD with the following command:

``` console
root@host # systemctl start xrootd@standalone
```
