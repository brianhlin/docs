OSG Site Documentation
======================

!!!tip "User documentation"
    If you are a **researcher** interested in accessing OSG resources, please consult our
    [user documentation](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/home) instead.

The [Open Science Grid](https://www.opensciencegrid.org) (OSG) provides common service and support for resource
providers and scientific institutions (i.e., "sites") using a [distributed fabric](https://map.opensciencegrid.org) of
high throughput computational services.
The OSG does not own resources but provides software and services to users and resource providers alike to enable the
opportunistic usage and sharing of resources.

This documentation aims to provide HTC/HPC system administrators with the necessary information to contribute resources
to the OSG.

Contributing to the OSG
-----------------------

We offer two models for sites to contribute resources to OSG users:
one where the [OSG hosts and maintains](#osg-hosted-services) resource provisioning services for OSG users;
and the traditional model where the [site](#self-hosted-services) hosts and maintains these same services.
In both of these cases, the following will be needed:

- An existing compute cluster running on a [supported operating system](/release/supported_platforms) with a supported
  batch system:
  [Grid Engine](http://www.univa.com/products/),
  [HTCondor](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/),
  [LSF](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/hpc-workload-management),
  [PBS Pro](https://www.pbsworks.com/PBSProduct.aspx?n=Altair-PBS-Professional&c=Overview-and-Capabilities)/[Torque](https://adaptivecomputing.com/cherry-services/torque-resource-manager/),
  or [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/).
- Outbound network connectivity from your cluster's worker nodes
- [Temporary scratch space](/worker-node/using-wn#for-site-administrators) on each worker node

!!!info "Don't meet the requirements?"
    If your site does not meet the above conditions, please [contact us](mailto:support@opensciencegrid.org) to discuss
    your options for contributing to the OSG.

### OSG-hosted services ###

To contribute computational resources with OSG-hosted services, your site will also need the following:

- Allow SSH access to your local cluster's submit node from a known IP address
- Shared home directories on each cluster node

!!!success "Next steps"
    If you are interested in OSG-hosted services, please [contact us](mailto:support@opensciencegrid.org) for a
    consultation, even if your site does not meet the conditions as outlined above!

### Self-hosted services ###

If you are interested in contributing resources by hosting your own OSG services, please continue with the
[detailed overview](/detailed-overview) page.
