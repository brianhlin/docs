Site Responsibilities
=====================

To avoid potential issues with OSG job submissions, please [notify us](mailto:help@opensciencegrid.org) of major changes
to your site, including:

- Major OS version changes on the worker nodes (e.g., upgraded from EL 7 to EL 8)
- Adding or removing [container support](worker-node/install-singularity.md)
- Policy changes regarding OSG resource requests (e.g., number of cores or GPUs, memory usage, or maximum walltime)
- Scheduled or unscheduled [downtimes](common/registration.md#registering-resource-downtimes)
- [Site topology changes](common/registration.md) such as additions, modifications, or retirements
- Changes to site contacts, such as administrative or security staff

It is also important to keep your software and data (e.g., CA and VO client) up-to-date with the
[latest OSG release](release/notes.md).
To stay abreast of software releases, we recommend subscribing to the <mailto:osg-sites@opensciencegrid.org> mailing
list.
